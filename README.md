## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for the I Ching divination web app, with main tasks and technical considerations:

---

### **Project Plan: I Ching Divination Web App**
#### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
1. **Define Scope**:
   - Confirm features: Hexagram chart, "Throw Coins" button, and styling requirements.
   - Decide on additional features (e.g., clickable hexagrams for details).

2. **Set Up Development Environment**:
   - Choose a code editor (e.g., VS Code).
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.
   - Decide on technology stack: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (vanilla or framework like React/Vue.js).

---

#### **Phase 2: Development**
1. **Hexagram Chart**:
   - **Task**: Create a 64-hexagram chart as a grid or interactive map.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Use HTML tables or CSS Grid for layout.
     - Add clickable hexagrams (if additional details are required).
     - Ensure hexagrams are clear and visually distinct.

2. **"Throw Coins" Button**:
   - **Task**: Build a button that generates a random hexagram.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Use JavaScript to simulate coin throws (3 coin tosses per line, repeated 6 times).
     - Map results to the corresponding hexagram.

3. **Styling**:
   - **Task**: Implement the pixel font and black/grey color scheme.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Use CSS for styling; import a pixel font (e.g., `Press Start 2P`).
     - Ensure the design is minimalist and responsive.

4. **Hexagram Display**:
   - **Task**: Show the generated hexagram to the user.
   - **Technical Considerations**:
     - Dynamically update the UI with the generated hexagram.
     - Include a clear display of the hexagram’s name and meaning if applicable.

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing and Debugging**
1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Test hexagram generation logic for accuracy.
   - Ensure the "Throw Coins" button works as expected.

2. **UI/UX Testing**:
   - Verify the design adheres to the pixel font and color scheme.
   - Test responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

3. **Debugging**:
   - Fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.

---

#### **Phase 4: Deployment**
1. **Hosting**:
   - Deploy the app to a web hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
2. **Final Checks**:
   - Ensure the app is live and accessible via browsers.
   - Perform a final round of testing on the live version.
